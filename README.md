# Lena by Bluer Reddish Green: non-Unity sources
Lena is a game about anxiety, quick thinking, original ideas, and living the life of a teenager.

Except for the whole alien-robot-battle thingy. That's not really a usual part of it.


## Game design
Lena, the game, explores new concepts inside of a charming, beautifully decorated 2D pixel-art landscape. [Celeste](http://celestegame.com) did anxiety first, we're pushing it farther. We're making music that represents this, we're making game mechanics, and we've actually come up with an implementation that directly creates real-life anxiety through music and game mechanics.

## Story
Lena is a fourteen-year-old girl who struggles with anxiety and depression. Her childhood crush, Alex, is still the love of her life. She wants to make a move but is scared that doing so could mess everything up and make it all awkward. So when failed scientific experiments literally banished from earth come back to life back here at home, she wasn't sure how to feel. Join Lena as she fights stress and the pressure of being in the splash zone of the assault on planet Earth.

We've created an accurate representation of anxiety and depression. Some pretty extensive lengths taken to ground the story in reality, we think you'll be interested in our little game-novel. We've taken inspiration from [Undertale](https://undertale.com)/[Deltarune](https://deltarune.com) and [Celeste](http://celestegame.com), and we're kinda mashing them together until we get a desirable result.

## ...other stuff???
We're proud to have LGBTQ+ representation in our game. Maybe we'll finally represent the world's population. And no, we're not gonna make token characters, the only tokens we'll have in our game are to prevent unauthorized access.

There's more to come, this code is only the beginning and [I'm](https://reddit.com/u/qeweyou) still working with my [developer team](https://twitter.com/brgdevs) on this game. We have a long, long way to go.
