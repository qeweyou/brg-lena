# Lena: by Bluer Reddish Green
## Non-Unity code
Lena is a game about anxiety, quick thinking, original ideas, and living the life of a teenager.

Except for the whole alien-robot-battle thingy. That's not really a usual part of it.

Lena explores new concepts inside of a charming, beautifully decorated 2D pixel-art landscape. [Celeste](http://celestegame.com) did anxiety first, we're pushing it farther. We're making music that represents this, we're making game mechanics, and we've actually come up with an implementation that directly creates real-life anxiety.

More to come, this code is only the beginning and [I'm](https://reddit.com/u/qeweyou) still working with my [developer team](https://twitter.com/brgdevs) on this game. We have a long way to go.
